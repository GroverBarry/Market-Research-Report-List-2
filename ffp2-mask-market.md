<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FFP2 Mask Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Valveless Mask</li><li>Breather Valve Mask</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The FFP2 mask market comprises two main types: valveless masks and breather valve masks. Valveless masks do not have an exhalation valve and are designed to protect both the wearer and those nearby from respiratory droplets. On the other hand, breather valve masks have an exhalation valve that allows for easier breathing by reducing humidity and heat accumulation inside the mask. However, breather valve masks may not provide the same level of protection to others as valveless masks, as they allow some respiratory droplets to escape through the valve.</p></p>
