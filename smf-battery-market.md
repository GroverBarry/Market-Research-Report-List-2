<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SMF Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AGM Battery</li><li>Gel Battery</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The SMF Battery Market consists of two main types: AGM Battery and Gel Battery. AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) battery is a type of maintenance-free battery that uses a special glass mat to absorb and hold the electrolyte. It is well-suited for applications that require high cranking power. On the other hand, a Gel Battery utilizes a gel electrolyte, which makes it more resistant to vibration and provides better deep-cycle performance. Gel batteries are commonly used in renewable energy systems and other applications that require long-lasting power supply. Both types are widely used for backup power, UPS, and solar systems.</p></p>
