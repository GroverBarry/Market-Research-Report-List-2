<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Pump Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Type</li><li>Electric Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The vacuum pump brake market consists of two main types, namely the mechanical type and electric type. The mechanical type requires the driver to press the brake pedal, which activates a mechanical linkage system that generates vacuum pressure to assist in braking. On the other hand, the electric type utilizes an electric motor to generate the necessary vacuum pressure, eliminating the need for a mechanical linkage system. Both types are used in automotive applications to enhance braking efficiency and safety.</p></p>
