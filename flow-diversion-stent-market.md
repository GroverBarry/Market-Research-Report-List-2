<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flow Diversion Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Channel</li><li>Dual Channel</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Flow Diversion Stent market consists of two types: Single Channel and Dual Channel. Single Channel Flow Diversion Stents have a single lumen or channel that is designed to divert the blood flow away from an aneurysm, reducing the risk of rupture. On the other hand, Dual Channel Flow Diversion Stents have two separate lumens that allow for enhanced flow diversion and better control over the blood flow. Both types aim to provide effective treatment options for patients with intracranial aneurysms and minimize the risk of complications.</p></p>
