<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adhesive-less FCCL Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-sided</li><li>Double-sided</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The adhesive-less FCCL (Flexible Copper Clad Laminate) market consists of single-sided and double-sided varieties. In single-sided FCCL, copper is present only on one side of the laminate, while the other side remains adhesive-less. This type is commonly used in applications where circuits are present on one side only. Double-sided FCCL, on the other hand, has copper on both sides, enabling the creation of circuits on both surfaces. This allows for greater design flexibility and is suitable for applications that require circuits on both sides of the laminate.</p></p>
