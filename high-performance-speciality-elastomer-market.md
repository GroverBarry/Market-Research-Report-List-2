<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Performance Speciality Elastomer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Elastomers (TPE)</li><li>Thermosetting Elastomer (TSE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high-performance specialty elastomer market is composed of two main types: thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) and thermosetting elastomers (TSE). TPEs are a blend of polymers that exhibit both elastomeric and thermoplastic properties, allowing them to be easily shaped and reshaped through heating and cooling processes. TSEs, on the other hand, are elastomers that undergo a chemical process called crosslinking, which permanently sets their shape during curing and cannot be reshaped. Both TPEs and TSEs are used in various industries due to their unique properties and capabilities.</p></p>
