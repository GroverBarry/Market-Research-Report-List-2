<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Seatbelt Pre-tensioner System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-tightening</li><li>Pre-roll</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive seatbelt pre-tensioner system market includes two main types: pre-tightening and pre-roll. Pre-tightening refers to a system that automatically tightens the seatbelt around the occupant's body in the event of a crash or sudden deceleration, reducing the risk of injury by securely holding them in place. On the other hand, the pre-roll system retracts the seatbelt slightly before a crash, improving the belt's tension and positioning, thereby enhancing its effectiveness in restraining the occupant during impact. These technologies play a crucial role in enhancing occupant safety in vehicles.</p></p>
