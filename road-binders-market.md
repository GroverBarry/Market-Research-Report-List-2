<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Binders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Type</li><li>Synthetic Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Road binders are materials used in the construction and maintenance of roads to provide stability and durability. There are two types of road binders: natural and synthetic. Natural binders are obtained from natural resources such as bitumen, an oil-based substance derived from petroleum. Synthetic binders, on the other hand, are artificially produced using chemical processes. These include polymers like styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Both types of binders offer varying advantages, such as natural binders being more cost-effective, while synthetic binders provide enhanced flexibility and resistance to aging.</p></p>
