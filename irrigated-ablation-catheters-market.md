<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Irrigated Ablation Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radiofrequency (RF)</li><li>Cryoablation</li><li>Laser</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The irrigated ablation catheters market is divided into four main types: Radiofrequency (RF), Cryoablation, Laser, and Others. RF ablation catheters use heat generated by high-frequency electrical currents to destroy abnormal tissue. Cryoablation catheters, on the other hand, freeze and then thaw tissue to remove it. Laser ablation catheters use laser energy to target and eliminate abnormal tissue. Lastly, the "Others" category includes alternative types of ablation catheters that may use different types of energy or mechanisms to achieve tissue destruction.</p></p>
