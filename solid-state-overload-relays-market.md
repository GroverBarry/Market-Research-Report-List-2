<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solid-State Overload Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Overload Relay</li><li>Magnetic Overload Relay</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Solid-state overload relays are electronic devices used to protect electrical systems from overloading by monitoring current levels and disconnecting the power supply if necessary. There are two main types: thermal overload relays and magnetic overload relays. Thermal overload relays use a heating element to detect excessive current, while magnetic overload relays use magnetic fields generated by the current to trip the relay. Both types provide reliable and accurate overload protection, but thermal relays are more suitable for protecting motors with long startup times, while magnetic relays are better for instantaneous overload protection.</p></p>
