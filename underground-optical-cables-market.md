<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Underground Optical Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multimode Fiber</li><li>Singlemode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The underground optical cables market includes two main types of cables: multimode fiber and singlemode fiber. Multimode fiber cables are designed to carry multiple signals simultaneously, using multiple rays of light. They are commonly used for shorter-distance communications, such as in local area networks. Singlemode fiber cables, on the other hand, use a single ray of light to carry signals over long distances with minimal loss. They are ideal for long-haul communications, such as telecommunication networks. Both types play a vital role in enabling reliable and efficient communication infrastructure underground.</p></p>
