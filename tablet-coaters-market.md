<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tablet Coaters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standard Coating Pan</li><li>Perforated Coating Pan</li><li>Fluidized Bed Coater</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Tablet Coaters are used in the pharmaceutical industry to apply coatings on tablets. The Standard Coating Pan is a traditional type, where tablets are tumbled inside a rotating pan while the coating solution is sprayed. The Perforated Coating Pan has holes in the pan, allowing for better airflow and drying. It is used for tablets that need faster drying times. The Fluidized Bed Coater uses a stream of air to fluidize the tablets, creating a turbulent bed. The coating solution is sprayed onto the fluidized tablets, resulting in a more uniform coating.</p></p>
