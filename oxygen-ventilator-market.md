<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oxygen Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilator</li><li>Noninvasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Oxygen ventilator market consists of two main types: invasive ventilators and noninvasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators are used when a patient cannot breathe adequately on their own and require a tube to be inserted into their airway to assist with breathing. Noninvasive ventilators, on the other hand, do not require a tube and are used when a patient can still breathe partially on their own but needs support to improve their respiratory function. Both types of ventilators play a crucial role in providing oxygen and assisting patients with breathing difficulties.</p></p>
