<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ice Melt Salt Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Ice Melt Salt</li><li>Solid Ice Melt Salt</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Ice Melt Salt market encompasses two main types: Liquid Ice Melt Salt and Solid Ice Melt Salt. Liquid Ice Melt Salt refers to a solution created by mixing rock salt with liquid additives that enhance its ability to melt ice and snow. This solution is often sprayed onto surfaces using specialized equipment. Solid Ice Melt Salt, on the other hand, consists of granules or pellets of salt that are spread manually or with the help of spreading equipment. Both types of ice melt salt serve the purpose of melting and preventing ice buildup on roads and walkways.</p></p>
