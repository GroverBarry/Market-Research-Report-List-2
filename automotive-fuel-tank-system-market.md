<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Fuel Tank System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multilayer Fuel Tank</li><li>Single-layer Fuel Tank</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive fuel tank system market is divided into two types: multilayer fuel tank and single-layer fuel tank. Multilayer fuel tanks are constructed with several layers to enhance safety and prevent fuel leakage in case of accidents. They offer better resistance to corrosion and permeation. On the other hand, single-layer fuel tanks are simpler in design and consist of a single layer of material. Although they are less expensive, they may be more prone to leakage and less effective in providing protection.</p></p>
