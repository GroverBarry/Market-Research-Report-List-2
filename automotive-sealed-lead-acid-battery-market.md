<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Sealed Lead-acid Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AGM Battery</li><li>Gel Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive sealed lead-acid battery market consists of two types: AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) battery and gel battery. AGM batteries use a glass mat to contain the electrolyte, allowing it to be absorbed by the plates, thus preventing acid spillage. This design makes AGM batteries highly resistant to vibration and suitable for deep-cycle applications. On the other hand, gel batteries use a gel-like electrolyte that immobilizes the acid, making them maintenance-free and more resistant to deep discharge. Both battery types are commonly used in automotive applications due to their reliability and longer lifespan.</p></p>
