<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial X-ray Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary X-ray Tube</li><li>Rotating Anode X-ray Tube</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The industrial X-ray tube market encompasses two main types: stationary X-ray tubes and rotating anode X-ray tubes. Stationary X-ray tubes are fixed in position and are typically used for applications that require low power, such as inspection and testing of thin materials. On the other hand, rotating anode X-ray tubes are used for high-power applications, where the anode rotates at high speed to dissipate heat generated during the X-ray production process. This allows for higher X-ray output and is commonly used in industries like aerospace, automotive, and electronics manufacturing.</p></p>
