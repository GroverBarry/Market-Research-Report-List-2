<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Grafting Screw Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stainless-steel</li><li>Titanium</li><li>Bioabsorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bone grafting screw market offers three main types: stainless steel, titanium, and bioabsorbable screws. Stainless steel screws are strong and durable, making them suitable for long-term use. Titanium screws are biocompatible and lightweight, making them ideal for patients with metal allergies or sensitivities. Bioabsorbable screws are made from materials that break down over time, gradually being replaced by the patient's natural bone. They eliminate the need for removal, as they are naturally absorbed by the body. Each type has its own advantages and is chosen based on the patient's specific needs and preferences.</p></p>
