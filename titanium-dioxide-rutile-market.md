<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Titanium Dioxide Rutile Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulphate Process</li><li>Chlorination Process</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Titanium Dioxide Rutile is a mineral pigment with various applications. It can be produced through two primary processes: the Sulphate Process and the Chlorination Process. The Sulphate Process involves dissolving ilmenite ore in sulfuric acid, followed by filtering and separating impurities to obtain pure titanium dioxide. On the other hand, the Chlorination Process utilizes chlorine gas to react with ilmenite, creating a titanium tetrachloride compound, which is then oxidized to produce titanium dioxide. These two processes generate different types of Titanium Dioxide Rutile, each with its particular characteristics and applications in various industries.</p></p>
