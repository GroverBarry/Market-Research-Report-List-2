<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Controlled-Release Compound Fertilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer Coated Compound Fertilizer</li><li>Non-Polymer Coated Compound Fertilizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Controlled-release compound fertilizers are designed to gradually release essential nutrients to plants over a specific period of time. Polymer coated compound fertilizers have a thin polymer coating that regulates the release of nutrients, preventing wastage and optimizing plant absorption. On the other hand, non-polymer coated compound fertilizers release nutrients immediately upon application, which can result in nutrient loss and inefficient absorption. Both types aim to provide plants with a consistent supply of nutrients, but polymer coated fertilizers offer a more controlled and efficient release, resulting in improved plant growth and reduced environmental impact.</p></p>
