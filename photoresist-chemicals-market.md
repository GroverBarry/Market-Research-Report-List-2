<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Chemicals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The photoresist chemicals market is divided into two types: positive photoresist and negative photoresist. Positive photoresist refers to a photosensitive material that becomes soluble in a developer solution when exposed to light, allowing the removal of the unexposed areas. It is commonly used in processes like microelectronics and printed circuit boards. On the other hand, negative photoresist becomes insoluble in a developer solution upon light exposure. This type is frequently employed in applications such as photolithography and manufacturing of semiconductors. Both types play crucial roles in various industries by enabling precise and accurate patterning processes.</p></p>
