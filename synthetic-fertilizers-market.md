<p><strong>The Synthetic Fertilizers Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soil</li><li>Foliar</li><li>Fertigation</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The synthetic fertilizers market finds applications in three main areas: soil, foliar, and fertigation. Soil application refers to the process of applying synthetic fertilizers directly to the soil, where they dissolve and provide essential nutrients to the plants. Foliar application involves spraying the synthetic fertilizers directly on the leaves of the plants, allowing them to absorb the nutrients through their stomata. Fertigation is a combination of soil and foliar application, where the fertilizers are mixed with irrigation water and applied to the soil, allowing for efficient nutrient absorption by the plants.</p></p>
