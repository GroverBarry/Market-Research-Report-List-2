<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SMP Based Elastic Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One Component</li><li>Two Component</li></ul></p>
<p><p>SMP-based elastic adhesives can be categorized into two types: one-component and two-component. One-component adhesives are pre-mixed and ready to use, eliminating the need for complex mixing procedures. They are typically applied directly from the container and react with moisture in the air to cure. On the other hand, two-component adhesives consist of separate components, such as resin and hardener, which are mixed together just before application. This mixing initiates a chemical reaction that leads to curing. Both types offer versatile and durable bonding solutions in various industries.</p></p>
