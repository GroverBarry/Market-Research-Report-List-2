<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Rubber-based Pressure Sensitive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent-based Type</li><li>Hot-melt Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The synthetic rubber-based pressure-sensitive market comprises two main types: solvent-based type and hot-melt type. Solvent-based adhesives contain a liquid solvent that evaporates after application, leaving behind the adhesive layer. These are commonly used in applications such as labels and tapes. On the other hand, hot-melt adhesives are solid at room temperature but melt upon heating, making them suitable for applications like packaging and assembly. Both types offer excellent adhesion properties and are widely used in various industries for their versatility and durability.</p></p>
