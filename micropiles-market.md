<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Micropiles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cased Type</li><li>Uncased Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Micropiles are deep foundation elements used to transfer loads from the superstructure to stronger soils or rock layers. There are two main types of micropiles based on their installation method: cased type and uncased type. </p><p>Cased type micropiles are constructed by drilling a hole, placing a casing into the hole, and then filling it with grout or concrete, providing structural support. These micropiles are generally used in areas with loose or weak soils.</p><p>On the other hand, uncased type micropiles are installed without a casing. They are formed by directly drilling a hole and injecting grout or concrete into it, thus relying on soil integrity to provide load-bearing capacity. These micropiles are typically used in stable or strong soil conditions.</p></p>
