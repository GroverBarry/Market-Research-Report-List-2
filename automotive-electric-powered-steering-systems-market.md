<p><p>Automotive electric power steering systems refer to steering systems in vehicles that are operated by an electric motor rather than a traditional hydraulic system. There are several types of automotive electric power steering systems - column type, pinion-and-rack type, double pinion type, and ball screw type. </p><p>Column type systems have the electric motor located on the steering column. Pinion-and-rack type systems use a pinion gear on the motor shaft to convert rotational motion into linear motion on a rack. Double pinion type systems use two pinion gears on the motor shaft for added stability. Ball screw type systems use a ball screw mechanism to convert rotational motion into linear motion on a ball screw shaft. Each type of system offers different advantages and is used in different vehicle applications.</p></p>
