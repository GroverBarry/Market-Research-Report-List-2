<p><strong>Shingles Vaccine Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>The shingles vaccine is a critical preventive medication used to combat the herpes zoster virus, which causes shingles in individuals who have previously had chickenpox. The global shingles vaccine market is highly competitive, primarily dominated by two major players: Merck and GlaxoSmithKline.</p><p>Merck, a leading pharmaceutical company based in the United States, has a long-standing history in vaccine development and innovation. Its shingles vaccine, Zostavax, was approved by the FDA in 2006. Zostavax was the first shingles vaccine available and quickly gained substantial market share. However, in 2017, Merck launched a more advanced and efficient alternative, Shingrix. This greatly impacted the shingles vaccine market and increased Merck's market dominance.</p><p>On the other hand, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), a global healthcare company headquartered in the United Kingdom, launched its shingles vaccine, Shingrix, in 2017. Shingrix quickly gained traction in the market and was considered to be more effective than Merck's Zostavax. GSK's expertise in vaccine development and manufacturing has allowed it to compete strongly in the shingles vaccine market.</p><p>The market growth of both Merck and GSK in the shingles vaccine market has been significant.
