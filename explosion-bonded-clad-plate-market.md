<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Explosion Bonded Clad Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Side Cladde</li><li>Double Side Cladded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The explosion bonded clad plate market includes two types: single side clad and double side clad. In single side clad plates, one side of the base metal is bonded with a thinner layer of the cladding material through an explosion process. This type is commonly used in industries where corrosion resistance or heat transfer is required. On the other hand, double side clad plates have both sides of the base metal bonded with a cladding material, offering enhanced durability and performance. They are often used in applications involving high pressure or extreme temperatures.</p></p>
