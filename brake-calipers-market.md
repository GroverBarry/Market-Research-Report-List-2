<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brake Calipers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Piston Caliper</li><li>Multi-Piston Caliper</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The brake calipers market consists of two main types: single piston calipers and multi-piston calipers. Single piston calipers use a single piston to apply pressure on the brake pads, which subsequently clamp onto the rotor to slow down or stop the vehicle. On the other hand, multi-piston calipers utilize multiple pistons to distribute the pressure more equally across the brake pads, enhancing braking performance and allowing for better control. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring effective braking in vehicles.</p></p>
