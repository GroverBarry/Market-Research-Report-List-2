<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aromatic Hydrocarbon Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Polymerization Method</li><li>Catalytic Polymerization Method</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aromatic hydrocarbon resins are a type of synthetic resin derived from petroleum-based feedstocks. These resins are commonly used in the production of adhesives, coatings, and printing inks. There are three main types of aromatic hydrocarbon resins based on their manufacturing methods. The thermal polymerization method involves heating the feedstocks to high temperatures, resulting in polymerization and resin formation. The catalytic polymerization method utilizes catalysts to speed up the polymerization process. The "others" market category includes alternative manufacturing methods such as the alkylation process, which involves reacting certain hydrocarbons with the feedstocks to produce the resins.</p></p>
